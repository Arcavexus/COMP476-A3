Brandon Huang - Winter 2020

Third assignment of Advanced Game Development for Winter 2020 at Concordia University. The assignment consists of implementing networking features in a 3D level, allowing two players to play the game simultaneously. Each player controls a tank that they can move and shoot bullets with around the level. When a bullet hits a wall, the wall is destroyed. The goal is to shoot the other player. There are also various pickups around the level.
